## Description
The purpose of doing this project is to develop a speed checker for highways and to alert the traffic authorities in case of any speed violation. Many lives are lost due to rash and rude driving on highways. </br>
This proposed project consists of a power-supply, Arduino UNO board, IR sensors, LED and Displays. The entire system gets its power from the power-supply and the Arduino Board as the major component of the whole systems.
